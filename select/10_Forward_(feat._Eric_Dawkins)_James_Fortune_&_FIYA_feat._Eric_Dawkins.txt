Chorus
I'm moving forward, I can't go back (2x)
I'm moving forward, I can't go
I'm moving forward, moving forward

Vs 1
Feeling hopeless seems like nothing's going my way
Giving up is never an option even on my worst day
I know that I was put here to make it to the finish
So I press on when others quit

Pre chorus
Forward, I am moving forward

Chorus

Vs 2
When it seems the past is trying to stop
I'm forgetting those things that are behind me
I have got my eyes set on the prize
I can't lose sight, I'm moving on

Pre chorus

Chorus

Bridge
All the sweat and the tears I cried
Had me seeing that I was born to win
Got a new destination in mind and that's forward
I won't stop until I get there

Chorus
